The concepts in this file are react routing and "Redirect", "useHistory" hook.
Insted of "Redirect", "useHistory" hook those are replced with "navigate" and "useNavigate" are used and updated for that.
coning to the URL parameters path parameter are used with "match.parasms.name" and at the route path "/Dashboard/:name" are used. now it will be updated to the "useParams"
are imported from the "react-router-dom" and we have to create an object for that " const {name} =useParams();"


Chat GPT version: 
-----------------

In this file, the concepts being discussed are React routing and the usage of the `Redirect` component along with the `useHistory` hook. Instead of using `Redirect` and `useHistory`, the code has been updated to use `navigate` and `useNavigate`. Additionally, instead of accessing URL parameters using `match.params.name` at the route path `"/Dashboard/:name"`, the code will be updated to utilize the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom`.

To make the necessary corrections in the code:
1. Import the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom`.
2. Create an object for the URL parameters using destructuring: `const { name } = useParams();`

By making these adjustments, the code will be updated to use the more current and recommended methods for handling routing and URL parameters in a React application.
